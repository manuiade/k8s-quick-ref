# K8S Quick Reference

Just a list of useful commands used for managing your k8s clusters. Also some basic yaml descriptors are provided in the respective folders with some lifecycle examples.

This is obviously not intended to be an exhaustive reference or replace any documentation, it is just a quick way to spin up and manage some k8s components for testing and learning. Please refer to the official documentation (https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) for further deepening.
